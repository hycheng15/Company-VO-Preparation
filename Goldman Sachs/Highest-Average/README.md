Given a 2-D String array of student-marks find the student with the highest average and output his average score. If the average is in decimals, floor it down to the nearest integer.

Example 1:
```
Input:  [{"Bob","87"}, {"Mike", "35"},{"Bob", "52"}, {"Jason","35"}, {"Mike", "55"}, {"Jessica", "99"}]
Output: 99
Explanation: Since Jessica's average is greater than Bob's, Mike's and Jason's average.
